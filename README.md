# TM4C1294 Bare IAR9

C programs for the Texas Instruments TM4C1294 Development Kit,
using IAR Embedded Workbench IDE 9.10

The included projects were developed on my Embedded Systems class at UTFPR.

Bare Metal development, manipulating all sorts of registers.
Things may break unexpectedly, change at your own risk.

## Projects

- [Lab 01](./Projects/Laboratorio_01) - Blinking LED using delay loops, analyzing clock speeds and compiler optimization levels
- [Lab 02](./Projects/Laboratorio_02) - Debugging exception handling, no code other than the other provided projects
- [Lab 03](./Projects/Laboratorio_03) - Displays Gray code counting on built-in LEDs using a Finite State Machine
